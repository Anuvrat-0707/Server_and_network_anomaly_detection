That's a lot of memory being used up.\n* Disk usage is also high, around 69%.\n\nThe anomaly type is a \"System Metric Spike\", which means that one or more of these values suddenly jumped up to an unusual level.\n\nNow, what could be causing this?\n\nOne possible explanation is that there's a resource-intensive program running in the background, consuming a lot of memory and disk space. It might be a legitimate program, but it's not behaving as expected.\n\nAnother possibility is that there's malware or a virus on the system, which is eating up resources and causing the spike in memory and disk usage.\n\nWe need to investigate further to determine the root cause of this anomaly.

This is likely causing a slight increase in CPU usage, which is still relatively low at 7.0%.\n\nThink of it like this: Imagine your computer is like a desk. The CPU is like your brain, processing tasks and making decisions. Memory is like the papers and files on your desk - it's where the computer temporarily stores data it's working with. Disk usage is like the filing cabinet in the corner of your room - it's where data is stored long-term.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there's a lot of \"papers\" on the desk (high memory usage), which is causing the CPU) to work a bit harder to keep up. But the real concern is what's causing the memory usage to spike? Is it a legitimate program or process that needs more resources, or is it something malicious like malware that's eating up all the available memory? That's what we need to investigate further to determine the root cause of this anomaly!"}
